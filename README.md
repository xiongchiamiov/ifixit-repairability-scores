The officially unofficial listing of iFixit's repairability scores for various
electronics.

A little while ago, we at iFixit released
[a fancy little table][Tablet Repairability] of the repairability scores for
tablets.  People went wild for it, which proves that we've been presenting
useful information in a non-useful manner.  That's sorta fixed now, but only
for tablets, which isn't terribly great.

So, I placed a bet with myself: could I write a script to automatically parse
out repairability scores using only our externally-available API before we
would manage to ship a similar table using internal tools?  The answer was yes.

Please note that [Miro] and crew are working hard on a concrete set of
guidelines for the repairability scores, at which point our lovely writers will
go through old teardowns and adjust them to be all nice and consistent.  This
hasn't happened yet, so a 5 in 2011 may be quite different than a 5 in 2013.
Read the teardowns for yourself and make your own decisions.
