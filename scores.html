      The officially unofficial listing of iFixit's repairability scores for
      various electronics.
	</p>
   <p>
      A little while ago, we at iFixit released <a
      href="http://www.ifixit.com/Tablet_Repairability">a fancy little
      table</a> of the repairability scores for tablets.  People went wild for
      it, which proves that we've been presenting useful information in a
      non-useful manner.  That's sorta fixed now, but only for tablets, which
      isn't terribly great.
   </p>
   <p>
      So, I placed a bet with myself: could I write a script to automatically
      parse out repairability scores using only our externally-available API
      before we would manage to ship a similar table using internal tools?  The
      answer was yes.
   </p>
   <p>
      Please note that <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/user/17">Miro</a> and
      crew are working hard on a concrete set of guidelines for the
      repairability scores, at which point our lovely writers will go through
      old teardowns and adjust them to be all nice and consistent.  This hasn't
      happened yet, so a 5 in 2011 may be quite different than a 5 in 2013.
      Read the teardowns for yourself and make your own decisions.
